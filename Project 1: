So there are three components of a website front-end: 
Content: done in HTML
Styling: done in CSS
Interactivity: done in JS

HTML: the structure of the content that goes inside the tags. Browsers provide default
    style, but its not the best.
CSS: controls the style of the HTML content. It lets you change colours, fonts, 
    layout, and more.
 
Types of URL's: 
    absolute: they include everything you are used to, http://...
    relative: they only include the directory, but they only work if they use
    the same domain as the current page

HTML Basics: 
    HTML documents use <tags> to tell the browser how to format our content
        ex: First level heading <h1>, paragraph <p>
    To get information from the user, use an <input> tag
        ex: "email" and "submit"
        ex: <input type="email"> <-- type is an attribute, and "email" is the value
        Attributes are kind of like options for each tag
    There is an attribute called placeholder that allows us to add default text to 
    our input.
        ex: <input type="email" placeholder="Your email">
        
 CSS Basics:
    Easiest way to add CSS to an HTML file is by using a <style> tag
    ex:   h1 {
            text-align: centre; //This is not exactly like JSON
          }
        
    Some common styles are: 
        text-align: (left, center, right, justified)
        background: sets the colour of the background (black, teal, etc.; rgb(0,0.0))
        -can also be set to the url of an image: url("...");
        background-size: cover; (or something else that we dont know yet)
        background-position: center; ("")
        color: sets the colour of any text
        font-family: sets the font of the text
        font-size: sets the size of the font in pixels
        border: the size of something?
        padding: amount of space between the edge of an element and the stuff inside it
        
        
    
    The <body> tag is meant to apply general conditions into all of its children tags
    The <title> tag controls what shows up in the browser tab. 
    
Images and Form Styling: 
    Add images using the <img> tag with a source attribute
        ex: <img src="/documents/picture.png">
    
    You can select an individual element by using square brackets
        ex: input[type="submit"] {
            background: red;
            color: white;
        }

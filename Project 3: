The DIV tag: allows you to style a group of elements with the same CSS,
and is also one of the most multi-purpose tags that we have

Classes: let you name and group HTML tags
    -they are attributes of tags
    -can individually style classes in the style sheet by labelling them
    .class followed by the proper CSS code
   
position: absolute; breaks it out of the documents regular flow
bottom: sets the distance away from the bottom

Line break tag: <br />
    This ends in a slash, because it is a self-closing tag
Small tag: preserves visual hierarchy

Advanced Layout:
    Span Tag: used inside another tag to make any bit of content display 
    differently from the rest of the stuff in the same tag
    -spans are like the inline equivalent of divs, so their text-align 
    styling must be replaced with float.
    
Gradients: Linear or Radial (self explanatory):
ex:
background: -webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, rgba(0,0,0,1), rgba(0,0,0,.4));
(-moz-)
Transitions: -webkit-transition: height .5s;
-moz-transition: height .5s;

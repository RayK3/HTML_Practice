Document Structure: 
    The Header Tag: a container that holds other elements, like <body>, 
    but it specifically holds elements for the website's header.
    
    Navigation: 
    -A new tag, which is very commonly used, is <ul> which stands for unordered
    list.
    -Inside an unordered list there are list tags, <li> that contain the members
    of the list.
    -Together, the <ul> and <li> tags create bullet points
    -<a> is an anchor link tag, which links to another page. This tag has an attribut
    href, which controls the URL the browser opens when you click the link on the page where
    href stands for hypertext reference
    -a full line could look something like this:
        ex: <ul>
                <li><a href="...">Hello</a></li>
            </ul>
 
CSS reset external CSS file:
    -There are two methods to add CSS into an HTML file. The first is <style.
    and the second is <link>.
    -<link> tag lets you include CSS from an external file rather than keeping
    it all written out in the HTML file
    -<link> tag needs two attributes: 
        -href - a URL where the Css file lives
        -rel - which should always be set to "stylesheet"
        
Navigation Styles:
    -Every HTML element has a display property, which can be set to various things
    such as inline or block
    -this is the same as the types of tags that display inline or block behavious from
    the last Project
    -padding in detail: you can control how much padding is on any side individually of a 
    element by putting in the individual values
    ex: padding: 0px 10px 0 px 10px (top, right, bottom, left)
    -link styles need to be explicitly set, as they do not inherit from their parent
    
Header Styles:
    -the same as what you have done previously
    -margin creates space on the outside of an element, while padding creates space
    on the inside
    -border takes three values, the first is the size in pixels (7px) the second is the type 
    of border (solid), and the third is the colour
    -border-radius sets the curve of the edges of the border to some radius in pixels.
    
Adaptive Content: allows the content of the page to dynamically fit the screen 
    that it is on.
    -This relies heavily on one margin command:
        margin: 0 auto;
    This makes the margin on the top and bottom 0 while the left and right are auto
    -This also relies on the width of the page to not be constant, so instead of 
    using width: 500px, use max-width: 500px
    
    -Media Query, is basically an if statement that only activates a style if the 
    condition is met. Its syntax is very easy
        ex: @media (max-width: 500px) {
              body {
                background: red;
              }
            }
Hex Color Codes:
    -Begins with a #, then it has three characters corresponding to red, green, and blue
    ex: #F00, where the red is full and the green and blue are zero
RGBA:
    -Another way to mix colours, where the a represents alpha (transparency)
    -the first three numbers corresponding to red, green, and blue are on a scale 
    from 0-255, and the third number is on a scale from 0-1
    
Basic JQuery JS:
    $("button").on("click", function() {
      alert("A button was clicked!")
    });
    -first selects the element, whose event we want to listen to.
    -calls the on function that takess an event-type and a function
